# Algorithms in Rust

Implementing sorting algorithms in Rust. 

## std::slice
- you can't increase the size of the slice
- you can, however, swap elements inside a slice using the **swap** method on slices
- you can split a slice with the **spit_at_mut** method into two slices


## test-driven-development 
When developing a library, the best way to test if the functions inside a library work, is which tests in the lib.rs or tests directory.
