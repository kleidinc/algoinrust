# Algorithms in Rust

Implementing sorting algorithms in Rust. 

## std::slice
- you can't increase the slice
- you can swap elements inside a slice
- you read and swap at the same time (which you can't do with a vec)

## test-driven-development 
When developing a library, the best way to test if the functions inside a library work, is which tests in the lib.rs or tests directory.
